## Overview
Mobile projects for <strong>personal usage</strong> and <strong>practicing</strong>. However, currently (2019/05/12) there are only 2 small Android apps. 

## Applications
1. ***ProjectXClient***  
Used to be the client side for my CI webapp (SimplestCI) (at [http://54.201.201.43:8080/autospring/home](http://54.201.201.43:8080/autospring/home)) to retrieve build notifications, store and show build info. However, due to new specfication developments in SimplestCI such as sending notification to Chrome browser, this client side is almost unused. 

2. ***SimplestValet***  
Simple application using Google Drive API to work with the Google Speadsheets those used to manage my expenditures.  
 Main features: Input new spending entry, visualizing spendings in a couple types of charts, retrieving amount spent in months, and full text search for spending entries. Future features should be the following: Managing multiple speadsheets, making widget to show amount spent recently, and some tweaks about currency.  

 This project uses MPAndroidChart library [https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) to create charts.

3. ***MVVM1***  
Project created for the purpose of practicing MVVM model (in the sense of Android architecture components, LiveData, ViewModel, etc.) and Kotlin language
